<p class='fw-light'>My name is Gabriel Lipkowitz. I am currently a PhD candidate at Stanford University in Mechanical Engineering advised by <a href="https://cheme.stanford.edu/people/eric-shaqfeh">Eric Shaqfeh</a> and <a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/joseph-desimone">Joseph DeSimone</a>. I'm passionate about developing novel interactive computational design tools for applications in personal fabrication, engineering design, and augmented reality. You can read more about my work below.</p>

<p class='fw-light'>In my free time, I love cycling 🚴, visiting art museums 🏛️, and seeking out good coffee ☕️. More than happy to chat about anything research and non-research related!</p>
