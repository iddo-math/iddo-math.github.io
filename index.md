👨🏼‍🌾I am Xianyu, a Ph.D student at [iGE-Lab/Prof. LIU](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/liufei#916273) in Zhejiang University (ZJU). 🎄My study is focused on UAV, image processing, deep-learning techniques especially in Agriculture & Ecology scenes. From 2024.7, I am visiting University of Toronto (UoT) at [Ensminger Lab](https://ensminger.csb.utoronto.ca/profile-luke-lu/)for 1 year.

🛸I have been working on UAV image super-resolution with varianve-enhanced diffusion-model during 2023, which is promised to bridge UAV and satellite🛰️ data to achieve large-area remote sensing image refinement.
🐣In 2022, I designed a UAV image-sequence direct geo-location and trait-extraction system for real-time crop field sensing.
🔑 Now I am work on 1.Paddy field weed sensing & grading; 2.Forest tree crown instance segmentation.

🌈My future interests also include automatic few-shots learning for anomaly (pest & disease stress) region detection at crop field using UAV hyper/multi-spectral imaging, points cloud☁️ segmentation & 3D traits measurment📏 using UAV LiDAR.
